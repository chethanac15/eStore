# Contributing to eStore

We love your input! We want to make contributing to eStore as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**

   ```bash
   # Backend setup
   cd backend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Update .env with your settings

   # Frontend setup
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create an issue first** - Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, please create an issue describing what you plan to do. This helps avoid duplicate work and lets maintainers provide guidance.

4. **Make your changes** and commit with clear messages

   ```bash
   git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issue (closes #123)
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Link to your feature branch preview (if available)
